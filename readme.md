# Atari 2600 Games with Deep Q-Learning

Welcome to the repository for training Atari 2600 games using PyTorch and the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm!

## Overview
This repository contains code that allows you to train an AI model to play Atari 2600 games using reinforcement learning techniques, specifically leveraging the Deep Q-Network approach. The code is located in the "main" folder, and you can initiate the training process by executing the `train.py` script.

## Requirements
To utilize this code for training, be aware that it demands significant computational resources and time. Due to the complexity of training RL models on Atari games, it's recommended to have access to high computational power and ample time for the training process to converge effectively. Feel free to adjust the parameters, for your own requirements.

You should be fine, if you just run this command for the environment: `pip install gym[accept-rom-license] gym[atari]`, but if this is not enough and you get errors, then good luck (This should work in Colab at least)!

## Results
See the `results` folder to explore a an attempt at training the model. Analyzing these results might provide insights into the learning progress and performance of the trained model. See the `final_report.pdf` for explanations and takeaways.
